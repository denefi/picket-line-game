# Picket line game

My first project during the Ironhack Web Developer Bootcamp. It`s a trivial arcade game using plain javascript. Interactivity and Game Logic are implemented through Event Listeners, DOM Manipulation and Intervals.

It's responsive (at least on horizontal screens bigger then 600px).
